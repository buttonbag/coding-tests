Translate this into current, readable code. Separate your CSS file from HTML.
- Get everything to be the exact (colors, font size, line-heights, box shadows). 
- Avoid using position styles in CSS.
- I used grid layout for the build but you should use flexbox. 
- The boxes should be the same height despite differing content (the box with the image should be the same size as the box with content).
- The design should be responsive.
- use any image you find as a replacement. 
- use any text you find as a replacement.

- missing the ease in hover animation (missing semi colon in stylesheets)
- it's not responsive
- - A little nitpicky (some hiring managers may call out any small imperfections), the font color is supposed to be a lighter grey, not black. For the titles, they're supposed to be bold.
