# 05 navbar

## instructions

Create a navbar 
- use semantic HTML tags i.e. <nav>, <button>
- first, create an unordered list of items that includes a logo, menu items and a button
- use flexbox
- don't declare any width or height, but you may use padding
- create a hover state for each nav items including the button

- I'll go over this with you after you finish because navbars are complex.
