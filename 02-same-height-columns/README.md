# same height columns

Try to get it as close as possible to the image of the prototype design. Your task is to translate this into current, readable code.  
- The boxes should be the same height despite differing content (the box with the image should be the same size as the box with content).
- The design should be responsive.
- The current image show the grid at its maximum width. 
- Come up with whatever the most used mobile size is for your version of the mobile view.
- The solutions only need to support the latest version of Chrome.
- use any image you find as a replacement.
